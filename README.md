"# curring" 
Currying is a functional programming concept where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a 
series of functions, each taking a single argument. Instead of passing all arguments at once, you pass them 
one by one.
Currying is  a Function with More Arguments.
Currying doesn't stop at two arguments. You can curry functions with multiple arguments, transforming them into a
 series of single-argument functions.
